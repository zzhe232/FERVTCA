# FERVT_CA
This is a code implementation of ZIYU ZHENG's Face Emotion Recognition thesis.We propose a new facial emotion recognition model base on FERVT model. In our model, We use coordinate attention to replace the high-level feature extraction part in the original model, aiming for a lighter architecture and enhanced capture of spatial information. Additionally, we modify the fusion of feature maps to obtain more detailed information and proposed a new loss function to help the model training.

## Installation and Usage
